## Main Lessons Learned About "Clean Code"
- **Consistent Naming**: Using descriptive and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes improves readability and maintainability.
- **Modularization**: Breaking down code into smaller, reusable modules with clear responsibilities enhances code organization and facilitates easier debugging and testing.
- **Documentation**: Providing clear and concise comments and docstrings helps others (and your future self) understand the purpose and functionality of each component in the codebase.
